# Project6NewsApp1
news app with java class and newsadapter
Project Overview
The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice.

The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.

Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you worked to build the News app. Along the way, you learned about connecting to the internet in Android, parsing responses from an API, updating the information in your app, and properly displaying that information. Practicing these skills is imperative in order to build apps that delight and surprise users by anticipating their needs and supplying them with relevant information.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Connecting to an API
Parsing the JSON response
Handling error cases gracefully
Updating information regularly
Using an AsyncTask
Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle


Project Overview
The final project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice.

You are expected to have passed the News App, Stage 1 project prior to beginning this project.

The goal is to add a Settings Screen to the News Feed app you made earlier in Part 1 which will allow users to narrow down the stories displayed in from the feed. The available preference options presented to the user will be left up to you to decide (e.g. publishing time, country, topic category, etc. )

Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you added a Preference screen that allowed users to select a minimum magnitude size for earthquakes that should be displayed , and to change whether they'd like to see earthquakes ordered by magnitude or time. One of the foundations of Android is that it should "Make me amazing". That often means that each user needs a slightly different experience, tailored to them and their particular preferences. Hence, we provide a way for users to adjust preferences in our app, and remember which preferences they've chosen.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Implement the Preference Fragment
Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity
Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
Update and display the Preference Summary
